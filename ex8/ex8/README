==================

In this exercise we used pre made classes and objects to create a working
'Asteroids' game! We learned how to use APIs, how to write our own methods
and learned some basic principles of games design.

README            This file

asteroidsMain.py  Contains the methods and functions that I wrote in order
                  to run the game properly.

gameMaster.py     I changed this file for the bonus to work. added methods and
                  variables for the heat-seeking missile. (see file header)

asteroidsBonus.py The game WITH a super cool Heat-Seeking missile!!! press 'h'
                  for the missile.

missile.py        The HeatSeeker class. contains methods that calculate it's
                  course.

torpedo.py        I added the method get_type() to differ the torpedos from
                  missiles.

baseObject.py     I added the method set_angle(angle) to be able to change the
                  angle to a specific value (for the heat-seeker)

= NOTE =

I made some changes to the behavior of the game (not only the bonus):
1) There is a limit to the ship's speed to make the game more playable
2) When the ship is destroyed, it re appears in the middle of the screen
   with 0 speed (same orientation, though), again to make the game to behave
   better
3) bonus #2 is also in the asteroidsBonus.py file.
