In this exercise I learned how to combine loops and conditions to solve
problems.

= Answers to question 9 =
=========================

*After reading this question, I found that there is no significant 
 difference between conversion between different bases, and therefore
 I re-wrote most of my code. The mathematic principle used to convert
 a number between bases is similar.

*The minimal change that needed to be done in the 7th or 8th question to
 solve the other one is swapping the 'to_base','from_base' variables values

*The new code I wrote can convert numbers from chosen base (smaller than 10)
 to another one, with the same changes that needed to be done for solving
 question 8 instead of 7 or the other way around. (base_source=from_base
                                                   base_target=to_base)
 For example, to change the 8th question code from decimal to binary
 to binary to decimal, the variable from_base needs to be changed to 2
 and the to_base variable needs to be changed to 10. That's it.
